###How the navigation menu works
A function is populating an unordered list in the HTML that has links to the sections in the page. 
The user can navigate the page scrolling it or clicking on the menu to go directly to an specific section. 
By scrolling in the page, the user activates the function that will highlight the link in the navbar menu that belongs to the section completely visible in the viewport. And also will make visible a gif of a cat and a slightly colored background for the active section. This is possible thanks to a function that includes an event listener and adds an active class to the link in the navigation menu AND to the section in viewport. 
The page also has an event listener for clicks made in the links of the menu bar. When the user clicks on a link of the navigation menu, the page smoothly scrolls to the section selected.
